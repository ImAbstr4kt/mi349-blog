                <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> is a game I have been waiting for since I graduated middle school. The game is a sequel to Team Cherry's critically acclaimed title <i>Hollow Knight</i>, and was announced all the way back in February of 2019. Having loved the first game, I was extremely excited to delve back into the world that Team Cherry created. At the time, I had no idea that I'd be a junior in university by the time of the game's release. But now, as of September 4th, the game is out, and I've been loving it. Many others have been loving it, too. So many, in fact, that upon the games release, the online storefronts for Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo, all simultaneously crashed due to the traffic from users trying to purchase the game. Luckily for me, I beat the rush and managed to snag the game on Steam before the stores went offline. Since launch, I've been putting any spare free time I have into playing (which, right now, isn't much). I've been surprised again and again by just how polished the game is. After so many years, I was curious if the game would be able to live up to my high expectations. In just the few hours I've put in, the game has exceeded them many times over. I'm looking forward to playing more throughout the next few months! I've included some statistics comparing Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong in a table below, so you can better understand how massive the impact of this game has been in such a short time.

                Current Music Fixation: Weatherday's <i>Hornet Disaster</i>
            </h2>

                I've been a fan of Weatherday's work since mid-2021 when I discovered their breakout album <i>Come In</i>. Their unique combination of lo-fi emo, noise-rock, and sparkly pop fixings instantly caught my ear upon first listen. Their previously mentioned debut album was produced and recorded entirely by them, with every instrument and vocal being recorded on their iPhone's built in microphone, giving the album a very amateurish and gritty sound. That being said, the pure emotion, heart, and shine in each track on the album pushes through the noisy haze, giving the album a recognizable and charming sound that I found to be extremely appealing. To this day, the albums 13-minute-long centerpiece track <i>My Sputnik Sweetheart</i> is an emotional epic that remains one of my favorite songs of all time.

                Their sequel album <i>Hornet Disaster</i> sees many returning elements and themes from the previous album, but this time with more typical pop structures and a greater focus on angsty themes and crushing, somber guitar leads. The sequel album also sees a lengthier runtime and track list, featuring 19 tracks clocking in at 76 minutes total. I was floored on my first listen of the record, which I was lucky enough to hear a day before the official release, as I bought a CD during their tour and listened to the album in full on my drive home from the show. Since the albums release, I've streamed over 1000 tracks from it, and I'm sure that number will be even higher by the end of the year.
